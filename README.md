# Single and Product Moments of Progressive Type-II Right Censored Order Statistics from Left Truncated Logistic Distribution with Application to Inference

# Synopsis
Thomas and Wilson (1972) gave a computational method for obtaining single and product moments of progressively type â€“ II right censored order statistics from an arbitrary continuous distribution through a mixture form that expresses them in terms of those of the usual order statistics from a sample of size n [cf. Balakrishnan et al. (2011) and Balakrishnan and Saleh (2011, 2013, 2016)].
When the values of m(number of failures) and n(sample size) are large, the computations using the above mixture formula is quite useful in filling some missing moments when the recursive algorithm is adopted. The R code deals with the validation of the method on left truncated logistic distribution. Various statistical estimates and parameters have been computed using the above method and have been used for further analysis which will be shown in the paper published.

# Software needed
  RStudio (R studio can be downloaded from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) 

# Running the program- Progressive censoring-Logistic Distribution.R 
Steps:-
1. click on Progressive censoring-Logistic Distribution.R
2. Click on 'Open this file in Github Desktop' icon which will appear on the top-right side of the program.
3. Assuming that Github desktop is installed in your system(which can be otherwise installed from https://desktop.github.com/), click on 'open link' after selecting Github Desktop.
4. Click on Clone repository and you will get a separate folder created in your local drive where Github is installed. You can now  access the R code (Progressive censoring-Logistic Distribution.R) and run the program assuming that RStudio is installed in your system.
