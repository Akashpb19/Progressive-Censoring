# Single and Product Moments of Progressive Type-II Right Censored Order Statistics from Left Truncated Logistic Distribution with Application to Inference

# Synopsis
Thomas and Wilson (1972) gave a computational method for obtaining single and product moments of progressively type â€“ II right censored order statistics from an arbitrary continuous distribution through a mixture form that expresses them in terms of those of the usual order statistics from a sample of size n [cf. Balakrishnan et al. (2011) and Balakrishnan and Saleh (2011, 2013, 2016)].
When the values of m(number of failures) and n(sample size) are large, the computations using the above mixture formula is quite useful in filling some missing moments when the recursive algorithm is adopted.
